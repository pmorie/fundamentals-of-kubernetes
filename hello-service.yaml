#
# SERVICE:
#
#       - A Service defines a set of Pods chosen using the Label Selector ('app: hello-world'
#         in this case), and  allows access to these Pods.
#       - By default services load balance traffic to the set of Pods. If your application
#         does not need a load balancer, you can create a 'headless' service by setting 'Cluster IP' (.spec.clusterIP) to 'None' 
#
